# Reinforcement-Learning
Some codes related to Reinforcement Learning

These have been done to learn RL as a part of my internship under Prof Dileep Kalathil

I have implemented Policy iteration, Value Iteration and Q learning algorithm on the frozen lake environment using the library gym that creates the environment.
I have also implemented the Q learning version for a continuous state problem of cart pole environment by discretizing the states and finally the deep q learning algorithm for the same environment.
